    <h1 id="connect-directly-to-producers-avoid-resellers">Connect directly to producers, avoid resellers.</h1>
<p>Arbiteg is an online platform that connects local business to a global market of buyers and provides both parties with the best possible prices.</p>

<p>We don’t buy or sell products. Instead we connect producers to final buyers, giving them the full price of their production without deducting high reselling fees.</p>

<h2 id="our-mission">Our mission</h2>
<p>As we have traveled around the world, we saw how prices in the First world differ from the prices in the Third world. Producers in the First having access to the best bids, prosper, while producers in the Third world are killed by resellers and isolation. Our goal is to make the market more fair and levell off the prices around the globe.</p>

<p>To do so we are creating an online paltform that connects buyers not only to the well established businesses, but also to small businesses that were isolated from the world before. By introducing small businesses that were preveosly isolated from the global economy, we decrease the prices for buyers and increase the prices for such businesses.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>Arbiteg is in the process of beta-testing, which means that we are still very small and can’t afford large marketing campaigns, hence we don’t have many clients. To not run into the “reaching critical mass” issue, we have decided to focus at first on very few products, specifically spices.
To be even more specific, cinnamon and pepper.</p>

<p>Cinnamon was chosen as a starting point for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It is grown in large quantities in Sri Lanka, where government heavily supports agricultural business and develops programs to support local farmers. Such programs will help farmers, working with us get quality certifications on cinnamon they produce and get free training to increase its quality.</li>
  <li>Cinnamon is expensive and there will be no need to transport tons of it to get sufficient cash flow, which decreases logistics issues we might face.</li>
  <li>There is an improper price difference between countries where it is produced and USA, identifying the need in our services.</li>
  <li>Cinnamon can’t be grown in USA, while it is frequently used in the food industry, leading to its high demand in USA.</li>
</ol>

<p>We would like to mention again that Cinnamon is only a starting point and later we will start selling a wide variety of products, levelling off prices and excluding resellers in all spheres in all parts of the world.</p>

<h2 id="our-partners">Our partners</h2>
<p>Currently we are are actively seeking for partnerships with restaurant chains and small grocery stores in Los Angeles. We have successfully connected with three farmers in Sri Lanka and which is even better, we are receiving huge support from one of the employees of the Sri Lanka government, who works in Ministry of Development Strategies &amp; International Trade. He helps us because he believes that through Arbiteg he will be able to improve lives of many farmers in Sri Lanka and this is one of the best proofs of concept that we have gotten so far. We can’t disclose his information yet, since he needs to get permission at work before he can be officially enrolled in any other side projects.</p>

<p>Even though we realize that without our American and European partners Arbiteg’s existance would be threatened, we make farmers’ interests our priority. In the future we will balance buyers’ and producers’ needs more, but now our aim is to help our partners in Sri Lanka to grow their business and improve their living conditions.</p>

<p>We are also planning to parnter non-profit organizations that share our values and work on improving quality of life in the third world countries.</p>
