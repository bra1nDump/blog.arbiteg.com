# Background

I'm majoring finance, currently specializing in business development and project management.  I don't like bragging, but thanks to my knowledge of the financial markets, specifically of such thing as arbitration I was able to come up with the idea of Arbiteg (and with the name too) and later on develop and shape this idea with my brother.

I'm in my first year in college, but I already have a decent amount of knowledge in my head, which I gained from books, attending classes at UCLA, online courses and other resources. 

# Reasons I am commited to this project

1. I hate watching how unfair and inefficient the current supply chains are. As we have mentioned in our main page, there are often more than 5 resellers standing between the producer and final buyer and producers get less than 20% of the final cost of their product. I want to fix this inefficiency, give buyers cheaper product and pay producers more for their hard work. 
2. I believe that every inefficient part of our world will be optimized sooner or later and the above-mentioned inefficiency of supply chains will be fixed as well, so why not being the ones to fix it?
3. With some degree of certainty, I can say that we will be supported by the people because they will see how unfair the system is and they will also see how much we improve it. 
4. The idea of Arbiteg is not too complicated and nearly "lies on the surface", hence the main component of success won't be the idea itself, but its execution and I have a strong belief that our team is the one that can execute it right.
