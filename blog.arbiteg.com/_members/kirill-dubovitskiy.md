# Background

4th year Computer Science student at UCLA. Former intern, now part time employee
at a real estate startup [padxchange]("https://padx.com"). Big fan of 
functional programming, yes, this is a real `Haskell` tattoo, and no,
I am not proficient in it (yet :D).

# Reason I am commited to this project

I love buying things on `Amazon`, but
I cannot 'unsee' South Park season 22 ...

... I really need to get back to editing this one day, 
but right now time to start on a homework
for my `Intro to Operating Systems Principles` class.
