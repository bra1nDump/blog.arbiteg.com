Why use Ceylon cinnamon in food?

1. It tastes and smells wonderful
2. It is considered as an alternative treatment for diabetes mellitus
3. It contains cancer-fighting enzymes
4. It helps to manage blood pressure
5. It appears to improve how the brain responds to insulin

We highly recommend you ordering cinnaon quils instead of powder, since than you will be able to turn quills into powder right in your restaurant/shop and the whole space will be filled up with wonderful cinnamon.
