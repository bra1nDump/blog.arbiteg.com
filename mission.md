# Connect directly to producers, avoid resellers.
Arbiteg is an online platform that connects local business to a global market of buyers and provides both parties with the best possible prices.

We don't buy or sell products. Instead we connect producers to final buyers, giving them the full price of their production without deducting high reselling fees.

## Our mission
As we have traveled around the world, we saw how prices in the First world differ from the prices in the Third world. Producers in the First having access to the best bids, prosper, while producers in the Third world are killed by resellers and isolation. Our goal is to make the market more fair and levell off the prices around the globe.

To do that we have created an online paltform that connects buyers not only to the well established businesses, but also to small businesses that were isolated from the world before. By introducing small businesses that were preveosly isolated from the global economy, we decrease the prices for buyers and increase the prices for such businesses.

## Getting started
Arbiteg is in the process of beta-testing, which means that we are still very small and can't afford large marketing campaigns, hence we don't have many clients. To not run into the "critical mass" issue, we have decided to focus at first on very few products, specifically spices.
To be even more specific, Cinnamon.

Why did we choose Cinnamon? Primarily because Madagascar is its 5th largest producer and Uganda's output is pretty significant too, while farmers, growing Cinnamon there receive only about 10-20% of the final price. This is the disgusting dishonesty that Arbiteg will solve. And by starting solving problems in countries like Uganda and Madagascar we will show the whole world that Arbiteg can solve such problems anywhere in the world.

#### Currently we are making a research on the market we are going to operate in and we are surveying Los Angeles based owners/managers of cafes and restaurants to better understand them. Since we value their time we are giving out 5$ Starbucks gift cards to every owner/manager of cafe or restaurant who will answer our 6 question survey. We encourage you to share this with anyone who falls under our requirements. Here is the link to the survey: https://arbiteg.typeform.com/to/aiY3YW

We would like to mention again that Cinnamon is only a starting point and later we will start selling a wide variety of products, levelling off prices and excluding resellers in all spheres in all parts of the world.

## Our partners
Currently we are seeking for owners of small grocery stores, restaurants and cafes, who care about the quality of the products they sell, and which is even more important those who care about the impact that their buying preferences have. On this stage we are looking for small groceries because we believe that small business owners more likely will help other small business owners.

Even though we realize that without our American and European partners Arbiteg's existance would be threatened, we make producers' interests our priority. In the future we will balance buyers' and producers' needs more, but now our aim is to help our partners in Uganda and Madagascar to grow their business and improve their living conditions.


We are planning to parnter many non-profit organizations that share our values and work on improving quality of life in the third world countries.
