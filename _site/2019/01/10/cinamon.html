<p>Over 80% of Mukono is agricultural based characterized as subsistence production. Partial commercial agriculture exists with farmers like SCOUL sugarcane plantations, Tea estates. Commercial farming is characterized by use of migrant labour from West Nile living in labour camps characterized by poor housing, sanitation and with little pay, and etc. to date high value crops like vanilla, flowers have boosted and replaced the declining volumes of coffee. However, more farmers who have lost coffee needs to be encouraged to take on such crops as a replacement. Subsistence agriculture is characterized by low acreage due to increasing family sizes and slicing of land, low productivity per unit acre arising from deteriorating soil fertility over cultivation and soil erosion. The females provide most labour and yet the men take most of the biggest share of farm proceeds. <a href="http://npa.ug/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Mukono-DISTRICT-Development-Plan-Final.pdf">pdf</a></p>
